## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

We will have the basic models for altitude migration.
This will progress to two pairs of equations for the residents and migrants eventually.
```{r}
##i = c(1:4)
## really simple function to show popn growth
Residents <- function(r,K,initial){
  initial*(1+r*(1-(initial/K)))
}

Residents(r=1.5,initial=120,K=900)
```
We see that with the example, the function is able to calculate the change after one season to the population size.


Next, we have constructed from this basic population model, an iterative loop showing the increase in resident population under varying parameter conditions.
```{r}
population = 10
year_vector<-c()
population_vector<-c()

for (year in (1:10)/2) {
  ##print(population<-Residents(r=1.5,initial=population,K=1030))
  population<-Residents(r=1.5,initial=population,K=900)
  year_vector<-append(year_vector,year)
  population_vector<-append(population_vector,population)
  #points(x=i,y=population)
}

df<-data.frame( 
  Year = year_vector,
  Population = population_vector) 


print(df)
ggplot(df,aes(Year,Population)) + geom_line() + xlim(0, 10) + ylim(0, 950) + ggtitle("Resident Population")

```

Now we can see how it increases over multiple seasons/years.


From this, we will try and produce a model which incorporates seasonality. In order to do this, our model will have to become a pair of functions alternating between summer carrying capacity and winter carrying capacity.
```{r}
Residentsummer <- function(r,K1,initial){
  initial*(1+r*(1-(initial/K1)))
}
Residentwinter <- function(r,K2,initial){
  initial*(1+r*(1-(initial/K2)))
}

population = 10
year_vector<-c()
population_vector<-c()
for (year in 1:30) {
  if ((year %% 2) ==0){
  print(population<-Residentsummer(r=0.5,initial=population,K1=2920))
  }
  else {
  print(population<-Residentwinter(r=0.5,initial=population,K2=2297)) 
  }
  year_vector<-append(year_vector,year)
  population_vector<-append(population_vector,population)
}

df<-data.frame( 
  Year = year_vector,
  Population = population_vector) 


print(df)
ggplot(df,aes(Year,Population)) + geom_line() + xlim(0, 30) + ylim(0, 3000) + ggtitle("Resident Population with Seasonality")
```
This appears to work and is producing a wave similar to a time series, but it is very sensitive to large differences between summer and winter carrying capacities, which may not reflect the real world data.

Moving forward with the current model, we shall try to start integrating migration into the model as well. This will come in two parts. Firstly, elevation based migrants, which will require us to split the resident species into multiple bins of elevation. Secondly, external migrants moving south for over-wintering, which will require both a resident and migrant function, similar to Lotka-Volterra competition models. We shall create functions for each of these aspects, and then try and combine them.
We start with the external migrants.
```{r}
Resident1summer <- function(r,K1,initialR){
  initialR*(1+r*(1-(initialR/K1)))
}
Resident1winter <- function(r,K2,initialR,initialM){
  initialR*(1+r*(1-((initialR+initialM)/K2)))
}
Migrant1summer <- function(r,B1,initialM)
  initialM*(1+r*(1-(initialM/B1)))

Migrant1winter <- function(r,K2,initialR,initialM)
  initialM*(1+r*(1-((initialR+initialM)/K2)))
```
Using these equations, we model the competition between these two groups.

```{r}
populationres = 200
populationmig = 10
year_vector<-c()
populationres_vector<-c()
populationmig_vector<-c()
for (year in 1:80) {
  if ((year %% 2) ==0){
  populationres<-Resident1summer(r=0.3,initialR=populationres,K1=2920)
  populationmig<-Migrant1summer(r=0.5,initialM=populationmig,B1=2000)
  }
  else {
  populationres<-Resident1winter(r=0.1,initialR=populationres,initialM = populationmig,K2=2297)
  populationmig<-Migrant1winter(r=0.5,initialR=populationres,initialM=populationmig,K2=2297)
  }
  year_vector<-append(year_vector,year)
  populationres_vector<-append(populationres_vector,populationres)
  populationmig_vector<-append(populationmig_vector,populationmig)
}

df<-data.frame( 
  Year = year_vector,
  Population_Resident = populationres_vector,
  Population_Migrant = populationmig_vector) 

df_long<-gather(df,key="key",value="Population","Population_Resident","Population_Migrant")

 ggplot(df_long,aes(x=Year, y=Population, colour=key)) +
   geom_line()
print(df)
print(df_long)
#ggplot(dfres,aes(Year,Population1),color="Population1") + geom_line() + xlim(0, 40) + ylim(0, 3000) + geom_line(data=dfmig,aes(color="Population2"))  +  ggtitle("Resident Population with Seasonality and Migrant")
```
Currently, this model is very unstable and demands an r value < 0.5. With certain parameter values it can stabilise but overall this suggests that this model is not sufficient. 
UPDATE: The winter equations had incorrect parentheses, has now been fixed and looks a lot better as long as r is still kept small.

We will also try creating a model to include altitudinal migrants and see if this fares similarly. Here we include new parameters alpha and beta to explain the effect each species group has on the other one.
```{r}
Res1summer <- function(r,K1,initialR1){
  initialR1*(1+r*(1-(initialR1/K1)))
}
Res1winter <- function(r,K2,initialR1,alpha,initialR2){
  initialR1*(1+r*(1-((initialR1+alpha*initialR2)/K2)))
}
Res2summer <- function(r,B1,initialR2)
  initialR2*(1+r*(1-(initialR2/B1)))

Res2winter <- function(r,K2,initialR1,beta,initialR2)
  initialR2*(1+r*(1-((initialR2+beta*initialR1)/K2)))
```
We now try to model the competition due to altitudinal migration.

```{r}
populationres1 = 300
populationres2 = 300
year_vector<-c()
populationres1_vector<-c()
populationres2_vector<-c()
for (year in 1:50) {
  if ((year %% 2) ==0){
  print(populationres1<-Res1summer(r=0.3,initialR1=populationres1,K1=2920))
  print(populationres2<-Res2summer(r=0.5,initialR2=populationres2,B1=2000))
  }
  else {
  print(populationres1<-Res1winter(r=0.3,initialR1=populationres1,alpha=0.1,initialR2=populationres2,K2=2297))
  print(populationres2<-Res2winter(r=0.5,initialR2=populationres2,beta=0.2,initialR1=populationres1,K2=2297))
  }
  year_vector<-append(year_vector,year)
  populationres1_vector<-append(populationres1_vector,populationres1)
  populationres2_vector<-append(populationres2_vector,populationres2)
}

df<-data.frame( 
  Year = year_vector,
  Population_Resident1 = populationres1_vector,
  Population_Resident2 = populationres2_vector) 

df_long<-gather(df,key="key",value="Population","Population_Resident1","Population_Resident2")

 ggplot(df_long,aes(x=Year, y=Population, colour=key)) +
   geom_line() +ggtitle("Two Resident species, one migrates")
print(df)
print(df_long)

```
This model seems to be reasonably stable, again within the same constraints.

Next we shall combine the previous two steps so that we have a model with two bins, which also incorporates both altitudinal and external migration. This will be the last step that we incorporate external migrants into the model due to uncertainty as to how they will be distributed among different patches.

We now need functions for two resident species, one which migrates from patch 2 down to patch 1, plus an external migratory species which also arrives in patch 1.
```{r}
Res1summer <- function(r,K1s,initialR1){
  initialR1*(1+r*(1-(initialR1/K1s)))
}
Res1winter <- function(r,K1w,initialR1,alpha,initialR2,sigma,initialM){
  initialR1*(1+r*(1-((initialR1+alpha*initialR2+sigma*initialM)/K1w)))
}
Res2summer <- function(r,K2s,initialR2)
  initialR2*(1+r*(1-(initialR2/K2s)))

Res2winter <- function(r,K1w,initialR1,beta,initialR2,sigma,initialM)
  initialR2*(1+r*(1-((initialR2+beta*initialR1+sigma*initialM)/K1w)))

Migrant1summer <- function(r,B1,initialM)
  initialM*(1+r*(1-(initialM/B1)))

Migrant1winter <- function(r,K1w,beta,initialR1,alpha,initialR2,initialM)
  initialM*(1+r*(1-((beta*initialR1 + alpha*initialR2  + initialM)/K1w)))
```


And then the model from these:
```{r}
populationres1 = 1000
populationres2 = 1000
populationmig = 1000
year_vector<-c()
populationres1_vector<-c()
populationres2_vector<-c()
populationmig_vector<-c()
for (year in 1:50) {
  if ((year %% 2) ==0){
  populationres1<-Res1summer(r=0.3,initialR1=populationres1,K1s=2920)
  populationres2<-Res2summer(r=0.5,initialR2=populationres2,K2s=2000)
   populationmig<-Migrant1summer(r=0.5,initialM=populationmig,B1=2000)
  }
  else {
  populationres1<-Res1winter(r=0.1,initialR1=populationres1,alpha=0.1,initialR2=populationres2,sigma=0.1,initialM=populationmig,K1w=2297)
  populationres2<-Res2winter(r=0.5,initialR2=populationres2,beta=0.2,initialR1=populationres1,sigma=0.2,initialM=populationmig,K1w=2297)
  populationmig<-Migrant1winter(r=0.5,alpha=0.1,initialR1=populationres1,beta=0.2,initialR2= populationres2,initialM=populationmig,K1w=2297)
  }
  year_vector<-append(year_vector,year)
  populationres1_vector<-append(populationres1_vector,populationres1)
  populationres2_vector<-append(populationres2_vector,populationres2)
  populationmig_vector<-append(populationmig_vector,populationmig)
}

df<-data.frame( 
  Year = year_vector,
  Population_Resident1 = populationres1_vector,
  Population_Resident2 = populationres2_vector,
  Population_Migrant = populationmig_vector) 

df_long<-gather(df,key="key",value="Population","Population_Resident1","Population_Resident2","Population_Migrant")

 ggplot(df_long,aes(x=Year, y=Population, colour=key)) +
   geom_line() +ggtitle("Two Resident species, one migrates + one migratory")
print(df)
print(df_long)
```
It is now quite difficult to keep all three populations stable. None of the species can have too small an r rate else they will become extinct.

Finally, we shall produce a model to mimic an ecosystem comprising of 8 bins with altitudinal but not external migration. To simplify this, we will not have birds migrating from one patch to all others, but rather just a few based off of the data found in Taiwan. Primarily, those in the highest patches will usually migrate two bins down. For now, we shall exclude upward migration from middle segments as this is theorised to be a response to external migration, which is not included.
```{r}
Res1summer <- function(r,K1s,initialR1){
  initialR1*(1+r*(1-(initialR1/K1s)))
}
Res1winter <- function(r,K1w,initialR1,sigma,initialM2){
  initialR1*(1+r*(1-((initialR1+sigma*initialM2)/K1w)))
}
Res2summer <- function(r,K2s,initialR2,alpha,initialM2)
  initialR2*(1+r*(1-(initialR2+alpha*initialM2)/K2s))

Res2winter <- function(r,K2w,initialR2,sigma,initialM3)
  initialR2*(1+r*(1-((initialR2+sigma*initialM3)/K2w)))

Res3summer <- function(r,K3s,initialR3,alpha,initialM3){
  initialR3*(1+r*(1-(initialR3+alpha*initialM3)/K3s))
}
Res3winter <- function(r,K3w,initialR3,sigma,initialM4){
  initialR3*(1+r*(1-((initialR3+sigma*initialM4)/K3w)))
}
Res4summer <- function(r,K4s,initialR4,alpha,initialM4)
  initialR4*(1+r*(1-(initialR4+alpha*initialM4)/K4s))

Res4winter <- function(r,K4w,initialR4)
  initialR4*(1+r*(1-(initialR4/K4w)))

Migrant2summer <- function(r,K2s,initialM2,alpha,initialR2)
  initialM2*(1+r*(1-(initialM2+alpha*initialR2)/K2s))

Migrant2winter <- function(r,K1w,initialR1,alpha,initialM2)
  initialM2*(1+r*(1-((alpha*initialR1+initialM2)/K1w)))

Migrant3summer <- function(r,K3s,initialM3,alpha,initialR3)
  initialM3*(1+r*(1-(initialM3+alpha*initialR3)/K3s))

Migrant3winter <- function(r,K2w,alpha,initialR2,initialM3)
  initialM3*(1+r*(1-((alpha*initialR2+initialM3)/K2w)))

Migrant4summer <- function(r,K4s,initialM4,alpha,initialR4)
  initialM4*(1+r*(1-(initialM4+alpha*initialR4)/K4s))

Migrant4winter <- function(r,K3w,alpha,initialR3,initialM4)
  initialM4*(1+r*(1-(alpha*initialR3+initialM4)/K3w))

```
So for 4 residents and 3 migrants we have the following model:

Being careful with initial population sizes, it is possible to make this model stable. It shows some interesting behaviour, especially with the effect one destabilised population can have on all others. Migrant 1 does significantly better than Resident 2 despite summering in the same patch, demonstrating the clear benefits of migration.
If the resources in a patch are decreased too dramatically, this will cause the model to destabalise, leading to the extinction of all the species. This does not seem entirely biologically realistic, as we are seeing a domino effect when one species goes extinct. This issue is most likely caused by the fact that the models don't stop running when a population goes into negative values.

On intriguing element is that when the r rate is increased for migratory species in the summer, their numbers actually go down - this warrants further investigation.
